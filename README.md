# JS---Morse-Code-Translator

Tasked with creating a morse code translator application using OOP.

Takes in user input from the DOM and user can choose the option of translating from english to morse and morse to english.

Alphabet(s) are stored in an array(s) and a Translator CLASS that takes in a parameter of 2 x languages creates a working translator

Translator class has a method that makes a 'cross-reference object' for corresponding letters in alphabets and spacing, which is stored in an array, that
handles the translation e.g. { z: --.. }

Written in vanilla Javascript with DOM query selection, Objects and Classes
